Hi!
This is the README for Minesweeper
This program was created by Harry Margalotti
Known Issues:
Un-flagging things:
    *this is a very simple fix i just ran out of time.
    *I need to create a boolean so only 1 mouse click is registered
Because of this known issuem, the flag counter which limits the number of flags you can place has issues as well.
Fixing one will very easily fix the other

What works?
Clicking
recursion
changing square colors
flagging squares that are not already revealed
if you click a bomb it prevents you from clicking any other squares, and will reveal all other bombs
then it says game over to indicate that the game has ended and asks the user if they'd like to play again
if you flag all of the bombs, the you get a message saying that the game is over and it asks you if you want to play again
you can choose beginner medium expert or custom
all 4 work.
a Small bug with the custom which is another easy fix if i had more time:
if you enter an absurd amount of bombs, the program does not crash, BUT an ugly white square which is normally the game appears.
All of the major features of the game are present and functioning without issue
